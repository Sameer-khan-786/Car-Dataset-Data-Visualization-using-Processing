# Car-Dataset-Data-Visualization-using-Processing
There are 406 observations on the following 8 variables: MPG (miles per gallon), # cylinders, engine displacement (cu. inches), horsepower, vehicle weight (lbs.), time to accelerate from O to 60 mph (sec.), model year (modulo 100), and origin of car (1. American, 2. European, 3. Japanese). These data appear on seven pages.

# Car Data Visualization Program

This program provides visualizations based on a dataset of cars.
How to Run:
1.	Ensure you have [Processing 4.3](https://processing.org/) installed on your system.

2.	Download and extract the code files.

3.	Open the `Project_2.pde` file in Processing.

4.	Click the "Run" button in the Processing IDE to start the program.

# Program Overview:
The program consists of multiple visualizations, each accessible through the menu.

Program 1: Line Chart
•	This program displays a line chart showing the average MPG (Miles Per Gallon) for different model years between 1970 and 1982.

Program 2: Histogram
•	This program visualizes the distribution of cars based on the number of cylinders.

Program 3: Bar Chart
•	This program displays a bar chart showing the number of cars for each model year.

Program 4: Pie Chart
•	This program presents a pie chart representing the distribution of cars by origin.

Program 5: Scatter Plot
•	This program shows a scatter plot of cars' MPG against their Horsepower.

Program 6: Scatter Plot 2
•	This program displays a scatter plot of cars' Horsepower against their Acceleration.

Program 7: Heat Map
•	This program presents a heatmap illustrating the correlations between different car parameters.

Program 8: Horizontal Bar Chart
•	This program showcases a horizontal bar chart depicting the fuel efficiency of different car models.
How to Use
•	After running the program, a menu will appear on the right side of the window.
•	Click on the respective program number to view the visualization.
Notes
•	Some visualizations may have hover-over details for additional information.
•	You can close the program window to exit.
